## Nanopore Sequencing Analysis Tutorial

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/zhaoc1/nanoflow.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Data set

First, create your `project_dir`:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/nanoflow_tutorial
  ```
Second, we downloaed the long and short reads for sample INFO59 from [Ryan Wick's paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29177090), which sequenced 12 Klebsiella pneumoniae on a single flow cell. We used [louiejtaylor](https://github.com/louiejtaylor)'s [grabseqs](https://github.com/louiejtaylor/grabseqs) to grab the sequencing data from SRA under theBioSample number SAMEA3357043.
  ```bash
  grabseqs sra -t 8 SAMEA3357043 -o ~/nanoflow_tutorial/data_files
  ```
